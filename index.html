        <p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
        <p>Thank you for recent application to join us at the Starz University's Science faculty to study<br>as part of your <i>PhD</i> next. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</i></p>

        <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
        <article>
            <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at anytime, however it would suit<br> us better if you could start at the beginning of the semester; the start date for each one are as<br> follows:</p>
            <br>
            <p>First semester: 9 October 2022<br>
                Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
                Third semester: 2 May 2023
            </p>

            <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
            <p>You can find more information about important university date on your website</p>

        </article>
        <h2>Subject of study</h2>
        <article>
            <p>At the Starz university, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects<br>
                fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. you seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br>researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br>you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

                <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resvertrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<br>measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), <br>
                    when the audience size exponentially increases (effct of 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)

                </p>

                <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>

                <p>So Please can you provide more information of these subjects, including how you'd<br> expected the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything you think we'd<br>need to know? thanks.</p>

            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <p>Yes, you are right as part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br> answer your questions, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
            <p>Polynessian chicken dance<br><span style="margin-left: 40px;"> A little known but very influencial dating as far as 300BC, a whole village</span><br>
          <span style="margin-left: 40px;">would dance around like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</span>
            
        <br>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">Before the Icelanders developed fire as means of getting warm, they use to practice</span><br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">this dance, which involved huddling close in a circle on the floor, and shuffling</span><br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movement. One of my fellow</span><br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">student used to say that he thought these dance inspired modern styles such twerking.</span><br>Arctic robot dance<br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">An interesting of historic missing information, english explores in the 1960s</span><br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">believed to have discussed the new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted</span><br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">movements, beind practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on<br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;">however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</span>

        </p>
            <p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p>
            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
            <P>Prof. Henry Nana</P>
